When I saw that there is GPGTools support for Airmail, I bought it.

I just bought [Airmail](http://airmailapp.com/), quite the nice Mac mail client.
It has got Gmail-like keyboard shortcuts, and I really dig mail clients that
support these keyboard shortcuts.  They are nicely vi-like :-)

After buying it, I downloaded the beta because it seemed to me that was required
to get GPGTools support.  At first, I had a little hard time to understand how
to install a plugin -- the plugin site that's referenced seems to say that it's
iOS only, but actually it works for OSX, too.

I'm impressed how smooth it is to do day to day work with emails.  Also, being
able to use Markdown to compose email is pretty cool.  Especially since it gets
translated to HTML before sending, so the recipient doesn't need to know I'm
using something geeky.  The compose experience is pretty cool, actually.  It got
rather boring to specify the font family explicitly for a bit of inline code.
Now I just mark it as code and off I go.  With Apple Mail, I never could figure
out how to do that.  And I don't want to tell my recipient to use Menlo, they
might not have that font.  And I certainly did _not_ want to use Courier!

I'm encountering a few snags, but I won't dwell on them here.  Maybe it's the
current beta.  Also, I've only been using this thing for a little while, so it's
too early.  I'm happy about the parts that work well, and I'll have a wait and
see attitude about the parts that don't work well just yet.
