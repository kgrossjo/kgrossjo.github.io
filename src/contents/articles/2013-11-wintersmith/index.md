This is my first post using Wintersmith.  Seems like it is easy enough
to use.  We will see how it goes.

Why did I choose Wintersmith?  Well, first I had the idea of hosting
my blog on github pages, then I saw that jekyll can be used, then I
learned more about jekyll and saw that it uses Ruby.  But right now,
I'm more interested in learning Node.js, so I thought perhaps I
can find something using Node.js, and -- lo! -- I found Wintersmith.

This guy explains how to make it work with github pages.

This seems to be the Wintersmith home page.

Everything below is standard Wintersmith content.  I want to keep it
for the time being for learning purposes.  I want to delete stuff
when I feel I've learned enough.

Let's see how code looks:
