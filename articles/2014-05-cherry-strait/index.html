It has the feel of the MacBook keyboard.
It is very flat.  Little force is required to depress the&nbsp;keys.</p>
<hr>
<p>Kudos to my colleague <a href="https://plus.google.com/+DanielFlinkmann/posts">Daniel
Flinkmann</a> who suggested the
Cherry Strait as a keyboard that looks and feels similar  to the MacBook
keyboards.  I must say, I like the feel of the MacBook keyboard. Some folks may
laugh and say that only the <span class="caps">IBM</span> Model 2 is the real keyboard (<a href="http://www.daskeyboard.com/">Das
Keyboard</a> anyone?). I let them laugh and I’m happy
with this&nbsp;keyboard.</p>
<p>(Some years ago they laughed at me for using a <a href="http://www.pfusystems.com/embedded-keyboard/hhkb/index.html">Happy Hacking Keyboard Lite
2</a>.  They asked me
whether I didn’t have enough money to buy a full&nbsp;keyboard.)</p>
<p>The only problem here is an oddity in the keyboard layout.
There is a block of six keys above the cursor&nbsp;keys:</p>
<table border="2" frame="box">
  <tr>
    <td>Insert</td>
    <td>Home</td>
    <td>Page Up</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Delete</td>
    <td>End</td>
    <td>Page Down</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p></p>

<p>The Cherry Strait modifies this from a 3x2 format to a 2x3 format, like&nbsp;this:</p>
<table border="2" frame="box">
  <tr>
    <td>Insert</td>
    <td>End</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Delete</td>
    <td>Page Up</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Home</td>
    <td>Page Down</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p></p>

<p>And the position of the Home key at the bottom left and the End key at the top
right, that’s just completely counter-intuitive.  Home should not be at the
bottom and End should not be at the&nbsp;top.</p>
<p>So I emailed their support and suggested to move things around, and they
said that the keyboard layout had to be modified to maintain the design
of this lifestyle product.  I must say, that’s a weird response.  It’s
not necessary to change the 2x3 layout, we just need to move the keys around.
I propose this&nbsp;layout:</p>
<table border="2" frame="box">
  <tr>
    <td>Home</td>
    <td>End</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Insert</td>
    <td>Page Up</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Delete</td>
    <td>Page Down</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p></p>

<p>I see the following&nbsp;advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having Home on the left and End on the right makes complete sense.
After all, usually, Home goes to the beginning of the line (i.e. to 
the left) and End goes to the end of the line (i.e. to the&nbsp;right).</li>
<li>Having Insert in the left column on the middle is good because that
spot is hard to find and most people don’t need the Insert key often.
Makes sense to put the most seldom used key in the most inconvenient&nbsp;spot.</li>
<li>Having Page Up above Page Down also makes complete sense based on
what the keys&nbsp;do.</li>
</ul>
